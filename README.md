Attrition Antidote: Healing Employee Retention Woes through Analytics

I am thrilled to share with you the recent Power BI case study I conducted for ABC Corporation, a multinational company grappling with employee attrition challenges. This case study aimed at comprehensively analyzing attrition data, identifying key drivers, and designing targeted interventions to improve employee retention.

Project Overview: 
For ABC Corporation's Power BI project, I focused on understanding and addressing employee attrition through a meticulous analysis of various factors. The case study encompassed the following key components:

1. Data Analysis: I delved into the data to analyze factors such as environment satisfaction, job involvement, personal information, and performance metrics contributing to employee attrition.

2. Interactive Dashboard: Leveraging Power BI, I designed an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore and visualize the data dynamically. The dashboard features charts, slicers, and drill-through functionalities for in-depth analysis.

3. Insights and Recommendations: Based on the analysis, I distilled key findings and provided actionable recommendations to address attrition challenges effectively.

Dashboard Features:
- The dashboard includes an overview page showcasing total employee count, attrition rates, and departmental attrition analysis.
- Detailed analysis sections cover environment satisfaction, job satisfaction, job involvement, personal information, and absenteeism among current and departed employees.
- Drill-through functionality enables deeper exploration of attrition trends and patterns.
Materials Included:
- Icons: A folder containing all the icons used in the dashboard for visual enhancement.
- Original Material: A folder containing the raw data and documentation used for the project's analysis.

Dimensional Model
As part of the project, I developed a dimensional model to organize and structure the data effectively. This dimensional model provided a framework for organizing data into easily navigable dimensions and fact tables, facilitating efficient analysis and visualization in the Power BI dashboard.

How to Access the Dashboard:
To explore the interactive dashboard, simply open the provided Power BI file using Microsoft Power BI Desktop or upload it to your Power BI Service account.
